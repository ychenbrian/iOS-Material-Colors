# iOS Material Colors

This is a color library for iOS developers, which contains all the [Material colors](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors).

## How to use

You only need to put `colors.assets` into any folder of your project (I created a `Resources` folder to store all assets).

### UIKit

`UIColor(named: "red-200")`

### SwiftUI

`Color("red-200")`

### [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift)

`R.color.red200()`
